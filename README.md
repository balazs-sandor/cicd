# CI/CD Pipeline Testing with Calculator App

This project demonstrates how to use a CI/CD pipeline using a simple calculator application. The calculator app performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We use this app to ensure that our CI/CD pipeline is set up correctly by automating the testing and building processes.
